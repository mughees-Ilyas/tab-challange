        <h4>Heading 1</h4>
        Notice that we’ve renamed the variable product to products, and we’ve changed the type to Product[].
        The [] characters at the end mean we want products to be an Array of Products. We also could have written this as:
        Array.Now that our InventoryApp holds an array of Products. Let’s create some Products in the constructor:
      </div>
      <input id="tab2" class="radio-option" name="tab-choice" type="radio"/>
      <label class="tab" for="tab2"> title 2 which is really long</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
        <h4>Heading 2</h4>
        Now that we have our top-level application component, let’s write the ProductsList component,
        which will render a list of product rows.We want to allow the user to select one Product and
        we want to keep track of which Product is the currently selected one. The ProductsList component
        is a great place to do this because it “knows” all of the Products at the same time.Let’s write the ProductsList 
        Component in three steps:
      </div>
      <input id="tab3" class="radio-option" name="tab-choice" type="radio"/>
      <label class="tab" for="tab3">title 3</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
        <h4>Heading 3</h4>
        Why is that wrong? Well, because in the case where your browser loads that template before Angular has run,
        your browser will try to load the image with the literal string {{ product.imageUrl }} and then it will get
        a 404 not found, which can show a broken image on your page until Angular runs.By using the [src] attribute,
        we’re telling Angular that we want to use the [src] input on this img tag. Angular will then replace the value
        of the src attribute once the expression is resolved. The thing to note about the ProductDepartment Component is
        the ngFor and the span tag. Our ngFor loops over product.department and assigns each department string to name.
        The new part is the second expression that says: let i=index. This is how you get the iteration number out of ngFor.
        In the span tag, we use the i variable to determine if we should show the greater-than > symbol. The idea is that given a
        department, we want to show the department string like:
      </div>
  </body>
